# Financial-Forecasting-Project

This is a project that focuses on financial analysis of data which includes budgets, forecasts and actual YTD data.
First, I used Power BI to do some minor data hygiene and changing data types.
Next, I used DAX, measures and calculate columns to create relevant financial comparisons.
Finally, I created a dashboard using all the data which includes primary KPIs, charts and maps visualizing the dataset and future trends.
